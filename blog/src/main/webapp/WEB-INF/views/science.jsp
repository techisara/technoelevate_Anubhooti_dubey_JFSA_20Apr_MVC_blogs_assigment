<h1>What Is Science?</h1>
	<p>Science is a set of tools and systematic methods for studying
		the natural world through observation and experimentation. Or more
		simply, science is a way of exploring and understanding the physical
		world. We humans love to find patterns, and we've been looking for
		patterns in the world as long as we've existed. Our brains, however,
		are not very reliable when it comes to identifying and explaining
		those patterns. In fact, we can be pretty terrible at it. We get sick,
		and we assume it was the last thing we ate, even though it almost
		never is. We see a cold winter and call climate change a hoax. So,
		many of our instincts are objectively wrong. Science is a way of
		avoiding that by using a systematic method called the scientific
		method: identify the problem, gather data, create a hypothesis, test
		the hypothesis, does the new data agree with the hypothesis?</p>
	<h1>The Branches of Science</h1>
	<h3>Natural science</h3>
	<p>Natural science is the study of the physical world. It can be
		divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science)
		and physical science. These two branches may be further divided into
		more specialized disciplines. For example, physical science can be
		subdivided into physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth science.
		Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that
		began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated
		the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more
		experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives,
		conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary
		in natural science.[112] Systematic data collection, including
		discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the
		16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals,
		and so on.[113] Today, "natural history" suggests observational
		descriptions aimed at popular audiences.</p>

	<h3>Social science</h3>
	<p>Social science is the study of human behavior and functioning of
		societies.[20][21] It has many disciplines that include, but are not
		limited to anthropology, economics, history, human geography,
		political science, psychology, and sociology.[20] In the social
		sciences, there are many competing theoretical perspectives, many of
		which are extended through competing research programs such as the
		functionalists, conflict theorists, and interactionists in
		sociology.[20] Due to the limitations of conducting controlled
		experiments involving large groups of individuals or complex
		situations, social scientists may adopt other research methods such as
		the historical method, case studies, and cross-cultural studies.
		Moreover, if quantitative information is available, social scientists
		may rely on statistical approaches to better understand social
		relationships and processes.[20]</p>
	<h3>Formal science</h3>
	<p>Formal science is an area of study that generates knowledge
		using formal systems.[115][22][23] It includes mathematics,[116][117]
		systems theory, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences
		share similarities with the other two branches by relying on
		objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They
		are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely
		exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical
		evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[27][118][111] The formal
		sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there
		is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[24][26]
		Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the
		empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to
		understand motion in physics.[119] Natural and social sciences that
		rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical
		physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical
		finance, and mathematical economics.</p>
