		(Penélope Cruz), while the fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier

		series started in 2003 with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the
		Black Pearl, which was met with a positive reception from both

		earning $960 million, and Disney released a fourth film, subtitled On
		Stranger Tides, in 2011 in conventional 2D, Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D.
		On Stranger Tides succeeded in also grossing more than $1 billion,[1]
		becoming the second film in the franchise and only the eighth film in
		history to achieve this. The franchise has grossed over $4.5 billion
		worldwide;[1] it is the 14th-highest-grossing film series of all time,
		and is the first film franchise to produce two or more movies that
		grossed over $1 billion.</p>
	<h1>fast and furious</h1>
	<p>Fast & Furious (also known as The Fast and the Furious) is a
		media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely
		concerned with illegal street racing, heists, spies and family. The
		franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows,
		video games, and theme park attractions. It is distributed by
		Universal Pictures. The first film was released in 2001, which began
		the original trilogy of films focused on illegal street racing, and
		culminated in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).
		The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast & Furious
		(2009), and was followed by five sequels, with the most recent, F9,
		released in 2021. A tenth and eleventh film are planned, and the main
		films are collectively known as The Fast Saga. Universal expanded the
		series to include the spin-off film Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs &
		Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this
		with the animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy
		Racers. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as
		well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the
		films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been
		released. The series has been commercially successful; Universal's
		biggest franchise, it is the seventh highest-grossing film series,
		with a combined gross of over $6 billion.[1] Critical reception for
		the first four films were mixed to negative until the fifth and later
		films, which were more positively received, albeit still mixed for the
		eighth and later films. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been
		the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Studios
		Hollywood, live shows, commercials, many video games and toys. It is
		considered the vehicle that propelled lead actors Paul Walker and Vin
		Diesel to stardom.[2]</p>
